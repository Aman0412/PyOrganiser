# PyOrganiser
PyOrganiser is a python script which organises the download folder of your windows machine. 

This was mostly just a test to figure out how to use git and github and understand the functionality of it for future purposes.

To run this on your machine you will have to change or create the directories of where the files that are being moved are going.
For example: in the code I have the script make the files go to a place in the downloads section (\Downloads\PyOrganiser) and within that folder I have several other folders such as - Picuture Files, Video Files and e.c.t
